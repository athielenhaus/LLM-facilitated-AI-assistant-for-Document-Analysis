In order to run a file on streamlit, we need to run the following command in the terminal:

python -m streamlit run C:\Users\Arne\Documents\GitHub\accreditationLLM_project\acc_checker\acc_checkerUI.py

It is essential to include python -m, otherwise the modules will not be recognized.

Also note that the virtual environment must be activated. In VS Code, this can be done by first running: .\venv\Scripts\Activate

NOTE: running the file within the IDE will cause a session-state error.
However, this problem will not occur if we simply run the file from the terminal.
